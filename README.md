# Ritual CLI

CLI for Ritual. Make an account at [the website](https://joeytan.dev/ritual) before installing with `sudo ./install.sh <account_name>`.

Then, use `ritual "your entry"` to make your daily entries.

This requires [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) to be installed. Development was done with version `1.22.0`, but I'm pretty sure the versioning isn't too strict for this.
